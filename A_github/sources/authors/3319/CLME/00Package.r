#' 
#' This package was introduced in Jelsema and Peddada (2015, under review). The method which 
#' is implemented is the constrained linear mixed effects model described in 
#' Farnan, Ivanova, and Peddada (2014). See that paper for more details regarding the method. 
#' Here we give a brief overview of the assumed model:
#' 
#' \deqn{ Y = X_{1}\theta_{1} + X_{2}\theta_{2} + U\xi + \epsilon }{Y = X1*theta1 + X2*theta2 + U*xi + e}
#' 
#' where
#' 
#' \itemize{
#' \item \eqn{X_1}{X1} is a \eqn{N \times p_1}{N x p1} design matrix.
#' \item \eqn{\theta_1}{theta1} are the coefficients (often treatment effects).
#' \item \eqn{X_2}{X2} is a \eqn{N \times p_2}{N x p2} matrix of fixed covariates.
#' \item \eqn{\theta_1}{theta2} are the coefficients for the covariates.
#' \item \eqn{U}{U} is a \eqn{N \times c}{N x c} matrix of random effects.
#' \item \eqn{\xi}{xi} is a zero-mean random vector with covariance \eqn{T}{T} (see below).
#' \item \eqn{\epsilon}{e} is a zero-mean random vector with covariance \eqn{\Sigma}{Sigma} (see below).
#' }
#' 
#' Neither covariates (\eqn{X_2}{X2}) nor random effects (\eqn{U}{U}) are required by the model or \pkg{CLME}. The covariance matrix of \eqn{\xi}{xi} is given by:
#'   
#' \deqn{ T = diag\left( \tau^{2}_{1}I_{c_{1}}, \tau^{2}_{2}I_{c_{2}}  , \dots , \tau^{2}_{q}I_{c_{q}} \right) }{ T = diag( tau1^2 I_c1, tau2^2 I_c2 , ... , tauq^2 I_cq) }
#' 
#' The first \eqn{c_{1}}{c1} random effects will share a common variance, \eqn{\tau^{2}_{1}}{tau1^2}, the next \eqn{c_{2}}{c2} random effects will share a common variance, and so on. Note that \eqn{c = \sum_{i=1}^{q} c_i}{c = SUM(ci), i=1,...q}. Homogeneity of variances in the random effects can be induced by letting \eqn{q=1}{q=1} (hence \eqn{c_{1}=c=ncol(U)}{c1=c=ncol(U)}).
#' 
#' Similarly, the covariance matrix of \eqn{\epsilon}{e} is given by:
#'   
#' \deqn{ \Sigma = diag\left( \sigma^{2}_{1}I_{n_{1}}, \sigma^{2}_{2}I_{n_{2}}  , \dots , \sigma^{2}_{q}I_{n_{k}} \right) }{ Sigma = diag( sigma1^2 I_n1, sigma2^2 I_n2 , ... , sigmak^2 I_nk)}
#' 
#' Again, the first \eqn{n_{1}}{n1} observations will share a common variance, \eqn{\sigma^{2}_{1}}{sigma1^2}, the next \eqn{n_{2}}{n2} will share a common variance, and so on. Note that \eqn{N = \sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i}{N = SUM(n_i), i=1,...k}. Homogeneity of variances in the residuals can be induced by letting \eqn{k=1}{k=1}.
#' 
#' The order constraints are defined by the matrix \eqn{A}{A}. This is an \eqn{r \times p}{r x p} matrix where \eqn{r}{r} is the number of constraints, and \eqn{p=p_{1}+p_{2}}{p = p1 + p2} is the dimension of \eqn{ \theta = ( \theta_{1}' , \theta_{2}')'}{ theta = ( theta1' , theta2')'}. Formally the hypothesis being tested is:
#'   
#' \deqn{ H_{a}: A\theta > 0 }{Ha: A*theta > 0 }
#' 
#' For several default orders (simple, umbrella, simple tree) the \eqn{A}{A} matrix can be automatically generated. Alternatively, the user may define a custom \eqn{A}{A} matrix to test other patterns among the elements of \eqn{\theta}{theta}. See \code{\link{create.constraints}} and \code{\link{clme}} for more details.
#' 
#' For computational reasons, the implementation is not identical to the model expressed. Particularly, the fixed-effects matrix (or matrices) and the random effects matrix are assumed to be columns in a data frame, not passed as matrices. The \eqn{A}{A} matrix is not \eqn{r\ times p}{r x p}, but \eqn{r\ times 2}{r x 2}, where each row gives the indices of the constrained coefficients. See \code{\link{create.constraints}} for further explanation.
#' 
#' The primary function of \pkg{CLME} is \code{\link{clme}}. The other functions in this package may be run separately, but in general are designed for use by \code{\link{clme}}.

#' The creation of this package \pkg{CLME}, this manual, and the vingette were all supported by the Intermural Research Program of the United States' National Institutes of Health (Z01 ES101744).

#' 
#' @details
#' The response variable \code{lfgr} was calculated as the change in log fibroid volume, 
#' divided by the length of time between measurements. The growth rates were averaged to produce
#'  a single value for each fibroid, which was scaled to represent a 6-month percent change in volume.
