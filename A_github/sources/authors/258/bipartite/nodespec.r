  # this is a purely qualitative measure at present, but could be extended to a
  # qualitative version in principle; in that case, distances should depend on
  # the number of interactions
  #
  # Note: unconnected parts of the network will yield infinite geodesic distances;
  # here we ignore these values (default), thus heavily underestimating distances!
  # The common alternative is to give unconnected paths the value of max(pathlength)+1, 
  # for no other reason than that it has to have some non-infinity value.

  # actually, nodespec is the inverse of closeness. Just apparently nobody has noticed ...

  # minimum specialisation: all polls linked to all plants, hence mean(geodist(.))=1, except with more than 1 compartment!
  
  # maximum specialisation: each pollinator has only one plant to pollinate. For k plants and n pollinators, usually k < n.
  # Hence, we have to allocate the remaining n-k pollinator species to the k plants.
  # To achieve maximum specialisation, we dump all remaining interactions on one pollinator,
  # whose value hence is: (n-k)+1

  # In a maximally specialised (but not compartmented) network, the bipartite plot looks like a zigzag-line. Hence, each pollinator is connected to two others (to the right and left of it), except the two final ones, which have only one. Thus, there are (n-2)*2+2 links in total. The mean distance for any species is thus dependent on its position in the zigzag. Terminal species have mean distance (1+2+3+...+(n-1))/(n-1). The central species will have (1+2+3+..+(n-1)/2) * 2.
