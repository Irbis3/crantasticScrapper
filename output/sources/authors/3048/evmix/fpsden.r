#' based on differences in the sequences B-spline coefficients is used to smooth/interpolate the counts.
#' Iterated weighted least squares (IWLS) for a mixed model representation of the P-splines regression,
#' conditional on a particular penalty coefficient, is used for estimating the B-spline coefficients.

#' @details The P-splines density estimator is fitted using maximum likelihood estimation, following
#' the approach of Eilers and Marx (1996). Histogram binning produces frequency counts, which are
#' modelled by constrained B-splines in a Poisson regression. A penalty
#' based on differences in the sequences B-spline coefficients is used to smooth/interpolate the counts.
#'
#' The B-splines are defined as in Eiler and Marx (1996), so that those are meet the boundary are simply
#' shifted and truncated version of the internal B-splines. No renormalisation is carried out. They are not
#' "natural" B-spline which are also commonly in use. Note that atural B-splines can be obtained by suitable
#' linear combinations of these B-splines. Hence, in practice there is little difference in the fit obtained
#' from either B-spline definition, even with the penalty constraining the coefficients. If the user desires
#' they can force the use of natural B-splines, by prior specification of the \code{design.knots}
#' with appropriate replication of the boundaries, see \code{\link[evmix:psden]{dpsden}}.
#' 
#' Iterated weighted least squares (IWLS) for a mixed model representation of the P-splines regression,
#' conditional on a particular penalty coefficient, is used for estimating the B-spline coefficients which
#' is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation. Leave-one-out cross-validation deviances are available
#' for estimation of the penalty coefficient.
#' 
#' The parameter vector is the B-spline coefficients \code{beta}, no matter whether the penalty coefficient is
#' fixed or estimated. The penalty coefficient \code{lambda} is treated separately.
#' 
#' The log-likelihood functions \code{\link[evmix:fpsden]{lpsden}} and \code{\link[evmix:fpsden]{nlpsden}}
#' evaluate the likelihood for the original dataset, using the fitted P-splines density estimator. The
#' log-likelihood is output as \code{nllh} from the fitting function \code{\link[evmix:fpsden]{fpsden}}.
#' They do not provide the likelihood for the Poisson regression of the histogram counts, which is usually
#' evaluated using the deviance. The deviance (via CVMSE for Poisson counts) is also output as \code{cvlambda}
#' from the fitting function \code{\link[evmix:fpsden]{fpsden}}.
#' 
#' The \code{\link[evmix:fpsden]{iwlspsden}} function performs the IWLS. The 
#' \code{\link[evmix:fpsden]{cvpsden}} function calculates the leave-one-out cross-validation 
#' sum of the squared errors. They are not designed to be used directly by users. No checks of the
#' inputs are carried out.
#' 
#' @return Log-likelihood for original data is given by \code{\link[evmix:fpsden]{lpsden}} and it's
#'   wrappers for negative log-likelihood from \code{\link[evmix:fpsden]{nlpsden}}. Cross-validation 
#'   sum of square of errors is provided by \code{\link[evmix:fpsden]{cvpsden}}. Poisson regression
#'   fitting by IWLS is carried out in \code{\link[evmix:fpsden]{iwlspsden}}. Fitting function

#' @note The data are both vectors. Infinite and missing sample values are dropped.
#' 
#' No initial values for the coefficients are needed.
#' 
#' It is advised to specify the range of support \code{xrange}, using finite end-points. This is 
#' especially important when the support is bounded. By default \code{xrange} is simply the range of the
#' input data \code{range(x)}.
#' 
#' Further, it is advised to always set the histogram bin \code{breaks}, expecially if the support is bounded.
#' By default \code{10*ln(n)} equi-spaced bins are defined between \code{xrange}.
