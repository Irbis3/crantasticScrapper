# 1. Save this file as `make-solution.R`, do not edit `make.R`.
#
# 2. Below, the full plan for creating the ragout is repeated.
#    Substitute the string `"meat"` with code that reads the `raw-meat.txt` file,
#    and finally write the result to a file `ragout.rds` with `saveRDS()`.
#    Remember to use `file_in()` and `file_out()`!
#
# 3. Run the script.
#
# 4. Edit the `raw-meat.txt` file.
#
# 5. Run `make()`. Do the results align with your expectations?
#
# 6. Create a new text file and use it instead of `raw-meat.txt`. Run `make()`
#    again.
#
# 7. Open the file `cooking-with-files.Rmd`, knit it. How does the code in the
#   `.Rmd` document access the targets we just built?
#
# 8. Extend the plan to knit the document via `rmarkdown::render()`. Remember to
#    use `knitr_in()` for the input file.
#
# 9. Verify that the `.Rmd` is processed if you change inputs or commands.
