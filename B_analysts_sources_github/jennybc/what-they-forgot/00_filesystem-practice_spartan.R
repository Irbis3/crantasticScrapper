## Sketch of how I would copy the .R files from, e.g.,
## ~/Desktop/day1_s1_explore-libraries
## to the current project

## build a path to the other project
## try to practice "safe file paths" -- but first, just make it work!

## get paths to the files in that directory ... just the .R files
## these are what you need to copy!

## form the new file names, based on existing file names

## copy the files from there to here

## list the files here (and look in file browser) to verify success

## Done already? Ideas to keep you going:
## Can you make your code cleaner, tighter, more readable, more robust? DO IT.
## Try again, now using the fs package.
## Can you figure out why Jenny names projects and files the way she does?
## Can you make a nice data frame of metadata, with one row per file or project?
